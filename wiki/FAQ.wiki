= Why didn't you integrate your changes into Paros Proxy? =

We asked Chinotec to integrate our changes into Paros Proxy, but the request was rejected. Therefore, we created a fork of the software.


= Is there any documentation? =

We are sorry, there is no documentation of Andiparos yet.


= Does Andiparos offer full smartcard support? =

To be honest, smartcard support has only been tested on Windows systems, yet. Smartcard support on different systems than Windows was not a requirement when the feature was developed. We would enjoy getting feedback about your testing results.
